While the sample provides individual records, the following POs are associated with the most prevalent issues:

### 1. Invoice & Price Discrepancies (Most Frequent: 17 occurrences)
These POs are flagged for **total price discrepancies** or **unit price mismatches**, which are the leading causes of reconciliation failure:
*   **PO1011, PO1054, PO1055, PO1061, PO1065**: All flagged for ""total price discrepancy"" due to incomplete price data or PO/Invoice mismatches.
*   **PO1064**: Flagged for ""unit price mismatch"" with a significant quantity gap (PO=69 vs. GRN=30).

### 2. GRN & Quantity Mismatches (High Impact)
These POs involve complex **Multiple GRN** or **Missing GRN** issues, which often lead to payment delays:
*   **PO1006**: High-priority discrepancy involving multiple GRNs and a significant ASN/GRN mismatch (ASN=122, GRN=149).
*   **PO1057**: Flagged for ""multiple grns"" where data is incomplete.
*   **PO1015**: Flagged for ""missing grn"" where neither ASN nor GRN data could be found.

### 3. Delivery & Penalty Issues
*   **PO1060**: A primary example of a **late delivery** discrepancy. The delivery occurred on 2025-07-30, two months after the PO date of 2025-05-30, likely triggering a penalty.

### Summary of Top Discrepancy Categories:
If you are looking to prioritize your reconciliation efforts, focus on these categories which represent the bulk of the 144 discrepancies:
*   **Invoice Issues (Price/Currency):** 46 occurrences (Top Priority)
*   **GRN Issues (Missing/Mismatch):** 42 occurrences
*   **Quantity Mismatches (Under/Over delivery):** 31 occurrences
