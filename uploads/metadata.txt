POs (Purchase Orders)
Records of what was ordered from vendors (item, quantity, price, dates). Acts as the starting point of the supply chain.

ASNs (Advanced Shipment Notices)
Vendor’s confirmation of what they shipped, when, and via which carrier — sent before goods arrive.

GRNs (Goods Received Notes)
Proof from warehouse/DC of what was actually received (quantity, date, location).

Invoices
Bills raised by vendors against the POs/shipments, with amounts and currency.

Payments
Actual money transfers made against invoices (amount, date, mode like UPI/RTGS).

⚡Together, these datasets simulate the core lifecycle of supply chain transactions → from order → shipment → receipt → billing → payment.
